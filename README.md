# Quality net - Deep-learning based method to filter whole blood slide tiles based on quality

Here I present methods to train and test a method designed to classify the quality of individual tiles in a whole blood slide between "good" (normal cellular density, not blurred, good illumination) from "bad" (blurry tiles, very high or very low cellular density).
